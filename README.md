## Abstract

The proliferation of explicit material online, particularly pornography, has emerged as a paramount concern in our society. While state-of-the-art pornography detection models already show some promising results, their decision-making processes are often opaque, raising ethical issues. This study focuses on uncovering the decision-making process of such models, specifically fine-tuned convolutional neural networks and transformer architectures. We compare various explainability techniques to illuminate the limitations, potential improvements, and ethical implications of using these algorithms. Results show that models trained on diverse and dynamic datasets tend to have more robustness and generalisability when compared to models trained on static datasets. Additionally, transformer models demonstrate superior performance and generalisation compared to convolutional ones. Furthermore, we implemented a privacy-preserving framework during explanation retrieval, which contributes to developing secure and ethically sound biometric applications.
